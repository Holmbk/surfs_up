Using Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, and GitHub
## Background

He now would like temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year round.![Hawaiian ice cream](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98991575/167265385-1e9ececd-fc0b-465d-a233-fefd22f5f32e.jpeg)
## Challenges
Python was used to extract the data. Numpy, pandas, datetime, and sqlalchemy were used in this analysis. The challenges was writing a query that filters the measurement table to retrieve the desired months of temperature.  The date was converted to a list then a Dataframe was created.

## Assumptions and Conclusions
After reviewing the June and December temperature statistical data, one can assume that the weather is consistant through the year and that the ice cream shop business should get traffic.  It is suggested that one should look at amount of tourist that are in Oahu during the year and the number of other ice cream shops are in the area.
